# Map Game

Forked from boilerplate: https://github.com/erick-otenyo/leaflet-boilerplate

The idea here is to recreate the [traveler iq flag game](https://www.travelark.org/tiq?game=flags) because it died with the death of flash. But that's just the start, eventually I want to make a generalized map game where anyone can build and upload their maps with images corresponding to coordinates for any topic, not just flags.

## Development

Install [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)

Install the [prettier extension for vscode](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode)

For now I'm just testing in the browser using chrome, just open index.html
