# Map Game

Forked from boilerplate: https://github.com/erick-otenyo/leaflet-boilerplate

The idea here is to recreate the [traveler iq flag game](https://www.travelark.org/tiq?game=flags) because it died with the death of flash. But that's just the start, eventually I want to make a generalized map game where anyone can build and upload their maps with images corresponding to coordinates for any topic, not just flags.
